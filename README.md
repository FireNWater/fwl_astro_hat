This repository is for software to drive the First World Laboraties Raspberry Pi-5 Astro Hat.

The FWL Astro Hat is an Rpi-5 hat designed to accept 12VDC from your field battery and power the attached Raspberry Pi-5 board.  The board then uses Solid State Relays (SSR's) to provide (4) ON/OFF 12VDC and (2) PWM controlled dew heater outputs.  There are also various other outputs such as UART, 1-wire, and 5VDC.
